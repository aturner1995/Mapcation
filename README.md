## Project Description 
Mapcation is a group project using four serverside APIs. We are using Amadeus, Foursquare, OpenStreet map and YouTube APIs to get out web application working.
You can get real time flights and fare for the flights.You will get suggestions about popular places and restaurants at your destination. you can add the resturant and places to the map and drop pins there. You can choose to watch from multiple youtube videos appeared on page about destination.

## Future Work

There are many features that can be added in future. We can integrate weather Apis and get the historical weather for the destination at the time of travel.

WE can potentially add currency convertor to our application for the user convenience. 

We can add many more features for the map. The map should display relevant information such as landmarks, tourist attractions, distance between two attractions and transportation options.
